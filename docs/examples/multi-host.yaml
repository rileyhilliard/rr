# Example: Multi-host setup with load balancing
#
# This is a PROJECT config (.rr.yaml) that shows how to reference multiple hosts
# for load balancing and targeting specific machines. Useful for small teams
# sharing build servers.
#
# NOTE: Host definitions belong in your GLOBAL config (~/.rr/config.yaml).
# See multi-host-global.yaml for an example global config that pairs with this.
#
# With multiple hosts configured, rr automatically distributes work:
# - Tries hosts in order with non-blocking lock checks
# - If a host is locked, immediately tries the next available host
# - If all hosts are locked, waits and round-robins until one is free

version: 1

# Reference hosts from your global config for load balancing
# If omitted, all global hosts are used
hosts:
  - mac-mini
  - linux-server
  - raspberry-pi

lock:
  enabled: true
  timeout: 10m       # How long to wait when acquiring lock on a single host
  wait_timeout: 2m   # How long to round-robin when all hosts are locked

tasks:
  test:
    description: Run tests on any host
    run: make test

  build-linux:
    description: Build Linux binary
    hosts:
      - linux-server
    run: make build-linux

  build-arm:
    description: Build ARM binary
    hosts:
      - raspberry-pi
    run: make build-arm

  docker-build:
    description: Build Docker image
    hosts:
      - linux-server  # Only the Linux box has Docker
    run: docker build -t myapp .

  gpu-train:
    description: Run ML training
    hosts:
      - mac-mini  # Only the Mac Mini has a GPU
    run: python train.py

# Usage:
#   rr test                     # Runs on first available host (load balanced)
#   rr test --host linux-server # Runs on specific host (no load balancing)
#   rr test --tag linux         # Runs on any host tagged 'linux'
#   rr build-linux              # Only runs on linux-server (task-specific host)
#
# Load balancing behavior:
#   - With multiple hosts and no --host flag, rr tries each host until one is free
#   - If local_fallback is true and all hosts are locked, runs locally immediately
#   - Otherwise waits up to wait_timeout, checking hosts in round-robin fashion
